      Studied the electrical properties of K+ and Na+-doped, ferrite-based HECsâ€”a novel green energy source.
      
      Investigated the behaviour of HECs under changing loads, the decay of generated current/voltage, and the
      change in cell efficiency over time. Compared with various electrochemical cells reported in literature.
      
      Used Arduino-interfaced INA219 sensors and Python for data collection and analysis. Curve fit current decay vs time curves to report various statistical metrics using scikit-learn
